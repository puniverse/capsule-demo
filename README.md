## A Capsule Demo

This is a simple demo that uses [Capsule](https://github.com/puniverse/capsule) for packaging and deployment. Both a Gradle build and a Maven build are provided.

The two [Maven assemblies](https://github.com/puniverse/capsule-demo/tree/master/src/main/assembly), one for a full capsule (with embedded dependencies) and one for a capsule with external dependencies (to be resolved at capsule launch), can be copied verbatim and used in any project without requiring modification.

If the assembly plugin is painful, checkout the easy to use [capsule-maven-plugin](https://github.com/christokios/capsule-maven-plugin) and its [demo project](https://github.com/christokios/capsule-maven-plugin-demo).
